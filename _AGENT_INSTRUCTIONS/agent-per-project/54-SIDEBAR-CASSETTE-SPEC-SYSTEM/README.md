# 54 — Sidebar Cassette Spec System

How the sidebar composes and displays a vertical stack of multi-feature cassette cards.

## Key Idea

The sidebar is a **managed stack** of cassettes. Each cassette is described by a
`CassetteSpec`, which wraps a feature-specific inner spec. The system:

1. Maintains an ordered list of specs (the **rack**)
2. Resolves each spec to a `SidebarCassetteCardViewModel` via feature coordinators
3. Wraps each view model in the appropriate card chrome
4. Renders the stack

Features own the content. Essentials owns the stack, chrome, and composition.

For the contacts/messages branch, the visible rack is no longer the only place
where flow meaning lives. Canonical flow state is owned by
`sidebar_flow_state_provider.dart`, and the cassette rack plus center-panel
routing are expected to remain coherent with that state.
