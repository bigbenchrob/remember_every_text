# Retained Historical Table Migrators Guide

Historical reference for the deleted retained projection migrator
framework that moved data from `macos_import.db` into `working.db`. Use this
only to interpret old logs, old docs, or old user data folders.

> Current conformance note (2026-06-08): new ordinary projection work must
> target the source-scoped conversation graph (`working_ss.db`) through graph
> projectors/repositories. The retained `MigrationOrchestrator`,
> `HandlesMigrationService`, `MigrationContext`, and `TableMigrator` framework
> are not present in the current source tree.

## Migrator Anatomy

Every migrator implements `TableMigrator` (typically by extending `BaseTableMigrator`). Core elements:
- **name**: Stable identifier used for dependency ordering and logging.
- **displayName**: Friendly label published in progress events (provided by `BaseTableMigrator`).
- **dependsOn**: Migrators that must finish before this one runs.
- **targetTables**: Working tables cleared during preparation (supplied by `BaseTableMigrator`).
- **validatePrereqs(ctx)**: Guard checks that run before any writes.
- **copy(ctx)**: Copy logic that moves rows from the ledger to the working projection.
- **postValidate(ctx)**: Final assertions to ensure the projection is consistent.

Migrators receive a shared `MigrationContext` instance from `HandlesMigrationService` when the orchestrator runs.

## MigrationContext Summary

`MigrationContext` (see `migration_context_sqlite.dart`) includes:
- `importDb`: `SqfliteImportDatabase` handle for retained `macos_import.db`.
- `workingDb`: Drift `WorkingDatabase` for retained `working.db` operations.
- `log`: Optional logger used by `ctx.log(...)` to emit orchestrator transcripts.
- `dryRun`: When true, preparation and validation run but copy steps skip writes.
- `incrementalMode`: When true, orchestrator preparation skips table truncation and migrators must preserve existing projection rows.
- `handleIdCanonicalMap` and `canonicalHandleInfo`: Deterministic identity lookup state shared by identity-related migrators.
- `ensureImportReady(label)` / `ensureImportClean(label)`: Safety checks that assert ledger attachment state before and after each phase.

### Utilities
- `BaseTableMigrator.count(...)`: Count rows in either database with consistent type handling.
- `BaseTableMigrator.expectTrueOrThrow(...)` / `expectZeroOrThrow(...)`: Assertion helpers that throw `MigrationException`.
- `MigrationContextSqlite.ensureImportReady(...)` / `ensureImportClean(...)`: Remove lingering `import_*` attachments and verify the import database can still be attached.

## Execution Lifecycle

`HandlesMigrationService` executes the orchestrator with a deterministic phase order:
1. **validatePrereqs**
   - Must not mutate data.
   - Confirm the ledger contains rows for required tables.
   - Verify canonical ID maps have entries for the relationships this migrator expects.
2. **copy**
   - Perform deterministic SQL from the retained ledger into `working.db`.
   - Use full-mode or incremental-mode insert/update semantics appropriate for the table.
   - Respect `ctx.dryRun`; always log planned work when skipping writes.
   - Do not restore or replay user overrides into `working.db`. User intent lives in `user_overlays.db` and is merged at read time by providers/read models.
3. **postValidate**
   - Recount rows to confirm the projection matches the ledger.
   - Derived message indexes and search indexes are rebuilt by `HandlesMigrationService` after all registered migrators finish.
   - Surface metrics via `TableMigrationProgressEvent` so the UI can display detailed stage information.

## Dependency Rules

- Declare every prerequisite in `dependsOn`; the orchestrator's topological sort enforces the order and fails fast on cycles.
- Group related tables into the same migrator when they must update atomically (for example, `ChatToHandleMigrator`).
- When introducing a migrator, update `HandlesMigrationService` to include it in the sequence and assign an appropriate progress stage.
- Mirror import dependencies: if an importer waits on handles before copying messages, the projection migrator should retain the same ordering.

## Validation Practices

- Use `BaseTableMigrator` helpers (`count`, `expectTrueOrThrow`, `expectZeroOrThrow`) to provide consistent assertion messaging.
- Call `ctx.ensureImportReady` at the start of each phase and `ctx.ensureImportClean` afterward to avoid lingering attachments or write locks.
- Preserve ledger identifiers verbatim; migrators should not mint new IDs.
- When migrating denormalized tables, compare stable source identifiers, counts, or timestamps that the current schema actually stores.
- Log before and after each phase using `ctx.log(...)` so progress transcripts identify failing migrators quickly.

## Adding or Modifying Migrators

Do not add retained migrators for ordinary app behavior. New ordinary
projection belongs in the source-scoped graph projectors and graph read models.
If old `working.db` contents matter for archive/recovery, treat them as
storage-retention evidence to migrate, export, or intentionally discard. Do not
recreate the retained migrator framework.
