# Retained Legacy Table Importers Guide

Historical reference for the deleted retained legacy ledger importer framework
that populated `macos_import.db`. Use this only to interpret old logs, old docs,
or old user data folders.

> Current conformance note (2026-06-08): new ordinary import work must target
> the source-scoped import spine (`macos_import_ss.db`) and conversation graph
> build lifecycle. The retained `ImportOrchestrator`, `ImportContext`, and
> `TableImporter` framework are not present in the current source tree.

## Importer Anatomy

Each importer must implement `TableImporter` (prefer extending `BaseTableImporter`). Core pieces:
- **name**: Machine identifier used for dependency edges and logging.
- **displayName**: Human-friendly label surfaced in progress events (provided by `BaseTableImporter`).
- **dependsOn**: List of other importer names that must complete before this importer runs.
- **validatePrereqs(ctx)**: Non-mutating guard checks.
- **copy(ctx)**: Transactional `INSERT` work that stages new data in the ledger.
- **postValidate(ctx)**: Ensures the copy produced correct row counts and referential integrity.

Historically, importers were constructed with the shared `ImportContext`
supplied by `ImportOrchestrator.run(...)`.

## ImportContext Summary

The retired `ImportContext` bundled:
- `importDb`: `SqfliteImportDatabase` handle that exposes retained legacy ledger helper methods.
- `messagesDb`, `messagesDbPath`: Live `chat.db` connection and absolute path for shelling out to the Rust extractor.
- `addressBookDb`: Live AddressBook connection for contact importers.
- `batchId`: Primary key from `import_batches` for current run.
- `dryRun`: Skip writes when true; validations still execute.
- `log`: Optional logger used by `ctx.info(...)` to emit structured progress.
- `extractor`: `MessageExtractorPort` for rich text decoding.
- `rustExtractionLimit`: Upper bound for extractor batch size (default 200000).
- `previousMax*RowId` fields: High-water marks that incremental importers can consult.
- `hasExistingLedgerData`: Signals whether retained legacy tables already contain rows.
- `scratchpad`: Mutable `Map<String, Object?>` for passing stats between phases (e.g., `messages.richTextApplied`).

### Convenience Helpers
- `ledgerSqlite`: Async getter returning the raw `Database` from `importDb` for ad-hoc SQL.
- `info(message)`: Emits a log entry if `log` is set.
- `readScratch<T>(key)` / `writeScratch(key, value)`: Share data among importers in one orchestration run.

## Execution Lifecycle

When the retired `ImportOrchestrator` ran, each importer went through three
phases:
1. **validatePrereqs**
   - Must not mutate data.
   - Verify source row availability, detect duplicate primary keys, check foreign keys.
   - Abort early with descriptive exceptions (`expectTrueOrThrow`, etc.).
2. **copy**
   - Use importer-owned deterministic SQL and transactions where the importer needs atomic multi-statement work.
   - Prefer deterministic `INSERT OR REPLACE` / `INSERT OR IGNORE` statements.
   - Respect `ctx.dryRun`; skip writes but still log intent.
   - For incremental importers, compare against `previousMax*RowId` fields and preserve prior imported rows.
3. **postValidate**
   - Confirm row counts match expectations (`count` helper).
   - Re-run key integrity checks, ensuring new rows have valid foreign keys into previously imported tables.
   - Optionally stash metrics in `scratchpad` for later phases (for example, message rich text coverage).

## Dependency Rules

- Declare upstream tables in `dependsOn` so `_sorted()` can enforce ordering. Current registry ordering is owned by `OrchestratedLedgerImportService`; the topological sort is the contract, not the literal source order.
- Avoid cross-importer coordination via global state; use `scratchpad` instead.
- When introducing new dependencies, update `../10-DATABASES/10-group-import-working.md` and revisit migration ordering so projection remains aligned.

## Validation Practices

- Use `BaseTableImporter` helpers (`count`, `expectTrueOrThrow`, `expectZeroOrThrow`) to keep messaging consistent.
- Guard against partial writes by requiring prerequisite tables to contain source rows before copying.
- Log before and after each phase (`ctx.info(...)`) so the orchestrator transcript highlights which importer failed if something goes wrong.
- For extract-dependent importers (like `MessageRichTextImporter`), check `ctx.extractor?.isAvailable()` and note results in `scratchpad`.

## Adding or Modifying Importers

Do not add retained legacy importers for ordinary app behavior. New source
facts belong in `lib/essentials/source_scoped_import/` and should project into
the conversation graph. If an explicit archive/recovery compatibility task
requires retained `macos_import.db` behavior, write a reviewed graph-era plan
first and update this page with the new concrete implementation path.
