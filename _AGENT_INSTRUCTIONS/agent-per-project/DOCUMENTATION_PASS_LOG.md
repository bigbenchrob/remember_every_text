# Documentation Pass Log

Date: 2026-07-09

Scope: Autonomous maintenance pass confined to
`_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS/agent-per-project/`.

## Summary

This pass updated the project documentation to reflect the current graph-era
and UI-walk state of MessageLens. It focused on correcting stale active
ownership claims, clarifying the current product/release phase, adding a
current-state orientation document, and improving discoverability of the large
RIO migration-history folder.

No application source code, tests, configs, generated files, database files, or
assets were modified as part of this documentation pass.

## Changes

| File | Change | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `README.md` | Updated `last_reviewed`; added current project phase quick fact; linked current-state, Essentials, Conversations, UI-walk, and release-exit docs; updated RIO description. | The top-level index still emphasized graph migration and did not orient future agents to the current product/UI-walk phase or the new Conversations feature boundary. |
| `01-PROJECT/05-CURRENT-STATE.md` | Created current-state snapshot. | Future agents need a concise answer to "what is current now?" without reading the entire graph migration history. |
| `01-PROJECT/02-architecture-overview.md` | Updated active feature list; added `features/conversations` ownership; clarified boundaries among Conversations, Messages, Search, and `essentials/conversation_graph`; linked current-state/release docs. | The architecture overview still listed `chats` as active and did not reflect the Conversation ownership repair. |
| `30-ESSENTIALS/README.md` | Updated current `ViewSpec` list to include `ViewSpec.conversations` and `ViewSpec.settings`; removed the stale active `ViewSpec.import` claim; clarified sidebar-independent system specs. | The active navigation model now routes Conversation specs through the Conversations feature; the old import spec wording was stale. |
| `40-FEATURES/README.md` | Updated `last_reviewed`; marked `chats/` as historical; added `conversations/`; corrected current code module inventory; removed stale active `reactions` module claim. | The code tree now has `features/conversations` and no active `features/chats` or `features/reactions` module. |
| `40-FEATURES/conversations/README.md` | Created canonical Conversations feature boundary document. | Conversation presentation was previously documented indirectly through UI-walk and migration notes; it now has a discoverable feature-owned home. |
| `55-READERS-INTEGRATORS-ORCHESTRATORS/README.md` | Added current-status guidance, navigation guide, and `85-RELEASE-EXIT-PLAN.md` to reading flow. | The folder accumulated many specialized numbered docs; a clearer index was lower-risk than physically moving historical documents. |
| `95-WALK-UI-TREE/README.md` | Added note that the UI walk is the active product-improvement phase and should not expand into unrelated hardening. | Aligns UI work with Document 85's release-first rule. |
| `95-WALK-UI-TREE/15-X-COLUMN-LAYOUT/README.md` | Updated from the earlier rigid four-band/AppPanelBandColumn framing to the current top/middle/content-start band model and sidebar content-start seam. | The code now includes `TopColumnBand` and `MiddleColumnBand`; the old README text was stale and over-rigid. |
| `DOCUMENTATION_PASS_LOG.md` | Created this log. | Required by the documentation-pass request. |

## Structure Decisions

The `55-READERS-INTEGRATORS-ORCHESTRATORS/` folder was not physically
reorganized during this pass.

Reason:

- Many files are historical but still useful as audit evidence.
- Moving them would risk breaking existing links and obscuring their chronology.
- A current-status guide and reading categorization solves the immediate
  discoverability problem with less churn.

The `40-FEATURES/chats/` folder was not deleted or moved.

Reason:

- It remains useful historical context for older chat terminology.
- The active docs now explicitly state that current user-facing Conversation
  ownership belongs to `features/conversations`.

## Important Concepts Clarified

- The current project phase is product release and UI/UX walk, not continuing
  graph migration as an end in itself.
- The ordinary data spine is graph-first:
  `chat.db / AddressBook -> macos_import_ss.db -> working_ss.db -> graph read models -> Message Evidence Spine -> overlay intent`.
- Retired `macos_import.db` and `working.db` are cleanup/diagnostic inventory,
  not ordinary app authorities.
- `features/conversations` owns user-facing Conversation identity
  presentation.
- `features/messages` owns message evidence surfaces, not Conversation cards,
  glyphs, favourites, or excerpt panel structure.
- `essentials/conversation_graph` owns graph facts and projection/build
  behavior, not user-facing Conversation widgets.
- Search requests Conversation excerpts; Conversations renders the Conversation
  lens; Messages renders the message evidence rows.
- X-column layout currently uses a top identity band and middle context band,
  with content beginning after the middle band.

## Needs Verification / Human Review

- The documentation says no active `lib/features/chats` or
  `lib/features/reactions` module was present in the July 2026 code inventory.
  Re-check if either module is deliberately reintroduced later.
- Some historical `42-SPEC-SYSTEM/REFERENCE/` documents still mention older
  `ViewSpec.chats` and `ViewSpec.import` examples. They were left unchanged
  because they live under `REFERENCE/`; future agents should not treat them as
  current implementation guidance.
- The exact release readiness status for onboarding, archival import, and final
  smoke testing remains governed by `55-READERS-INTEGRATORS-ORCHESTRATORS/85-RELEASE-EXIT-PLAN.md`
  and should be verified against the current app before release decisions.
- The X-column layout implementation is active UI-walk work. The docs now
  describe the current direction, but visual tuning remains a design/review
  matter rather than a completed universal layout standard.

# Documentation Information Architecture Pass

Date: 2026-07-09

Scope: Structural and navigational review confined to
`_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS/agent-per-project/`.

## Summary

This pass treated the documentation as a navigation product. It improved
discoverability and current-vs-history signaling without moving large
historical folders or rewriting technical content.

No application source code, tests, configs, generated files, database files, or
assets were modified as part of this IA pass.

## Changes

| File | Change | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `00-START-HERE.md` | Created cold-start orientation page. | New readers needed one short entry point that distinguishes current mode, canonical owners, and historical reference areas. |
| `55-READERS-INTEGRATORS-ORCHESTRATORS/TOPIC_INDEX.md` | Created topic-based index. | The folder combines durable invariants with numbered graph-migration history; topic navigation is safer than physical reorganization. |
| `45-NEW-FEATURE-ADDITION/INDEX.md` | Created staging/history index. | The folder contains active planning, migrated guidance, and historical proposals; readers need to verify currency before implementing. |
| `45-NEW-FEATURE-ADDITION/README.md` | Linked `INDEX.md`; clarified active/planning table wording; updated review date. | The README previously implied the folder was mainly active work; it now flags the mixed staging/history role. |
| `55-READERS-INTEGRATORS-ORCHESTRATORS/README.md` | Linked `TOPIC_INDEX.md` from Current Status. | Future readers should not infer document currency from file number alone. |
| `README.md` | Linked `00-START-HERE.md` from the opening section and frontmatter; added a Large Folder Navigation section for `45` and `55` indexes. | The top-level index now has a clearer first-read path and makes the large-folder navigation aids discoverable. |
| `DOCUMENTATION_INFORMATION_ARCHITECTURE_REPORT.md` | Created IA report. | Required deliverable documenting strengths, weaknesses, structural changes, unchanged folders, and recommendations. |
| `DOCUMENTATION_PASS_LOG.md` | Appended this IA-pass section. | Required change log for documentation maintenance. |

## Structure Decisions

The pass intentionally avoided moving large historical folder trees.

Reason:

- Existing links and chronological evidence are valuable.
- The main problem was navigation, not missing content.
- Index files reduce confusion without creating link churn.

## Needs Verification / Human Review

- Confirm whether `45-NEW-FEATURE-ADDITION/03-INTRODUCE-SIDEBAR-CONTENT-SEAM/`,
  `archive-canonical-attachments/`, and `ephemeral-sidebar-projection/` remain
  the intended active/planning feature folders.
- Consider a later archive taxonomy for `45-NEW-FEATURE-ADDITION/` only after
  the current release/UI-walk phase.
