# Feature Charter — Chat Handles

> Current conformance note (2026-04-21): this folder is a draft scaffold for handle identity concerns. Current concrete handle review/linking code lives primarily under `lib/features/handles`, while manual handle-to-contact writes are overlay-only through `lib/features/contacts/application/services/manual_handle_link_service.dart`.

## Mission
- Capture how canonical handle identities are created, normalized, and associated with participants.
- Document inbound data sources (macOS Messages handles, manual overrides) and the invariants we must preserve.

## Primary Outcomes
- Deterministic mapping from Apple handle rows to application `HandleId`s.
- Clear override story for user-driven corrections (see manual-handle-to-contact-linking).
- Cohesive auditing so migrations and UI features share the same handle vocabulary.

## Success Metrics
- Handle normalization errors detected in import logs.
- Manual override latency between overlay write and projection update.
- Regression tests covering canonicalization edge cases.

## Non-Goals
- Contact display formatting (owned by contacts feature).
- Navigation or UI presentation of handles (covered elsewhere).

## Stakeholders & Dependencies
- Depends on import/migration pipelines for source data fidelity.
- Provides identifiers consumed by chats, messages, and search features.

## Open Questions
- How do we stage alternative normalization strategies (e.g., phone formatting) without breaking projections?
- What telemetry do we need to catch drift between import ledger and working projection?
