# State & Provider Inventory — Chat Handles

> Current conformance note (2026-04-21): provider names below were draft placeholders. Current concrete providers include `strayHandlesProvider`, `spamCandidateHandlesProvider`, `dismissedHandlesProvider`, `strayHandleModeProvider`, `virtualParticipantsProvider`, and contacts/handles merge repositories.

| Provider | Type | Parameters | Description | Downstream Users |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `handleCanonicalizerProvider` | @riverpod class | N/A | Normalizes raw handle data into canonical identifiers. | Import + migration orchestration. |
| `handlesByChatProvider` | @riverpod family | `chatId` | Exposes handle roster for a chat. | Chats feature UI, search indexing. |
| `manualHandleOverridesProvider` | @riverpod future | N/A | Loads manual overrides from overlay DB. | Manual link UI, participant resolution. |

## State Objects & Caches
- Drift DAOs: `HandlesDao`, projection caches.
- Derived caches for normalized phone/email formats.

## Invalidations & Triggers
- Overlay writes should invalidate `manualHandleOverridesProvider` and any derived caches.
- Import refresh triggers full rebuild, ensure providers bubble change events.

## TODO
- Audit existing providers in `lib/features/contacts` and consolidate here.
- Decide whether search feature should subscribe directly or via facade provider.
