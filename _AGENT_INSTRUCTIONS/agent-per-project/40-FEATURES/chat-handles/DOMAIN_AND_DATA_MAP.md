# Domain & Data Map — Chat Handles

> Current conformance note (2026-04-21): the current overlay table for manual links is `handle_to_participant_overrides`, not `handle_overrides`. The current handles table is `handles_canonical`; stray-handle providers live under `lib/features/handles/infrastructure/repositories/stray_handles_provider.dart`.

## Core Entities
- `HandleId` value object — canonical identifier shared across aggregates.
- `Handle` projection rows in `working.db` (`working.handles`).
- Import ledger tables: `import_handles`, `import_chat_handle_join`.

## Supporting Tables & Views
| Database | Table/View | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `db-import` | `handles` | Raw Apple handle rows with service + identifier. | Immutable staging data.
| `db-import` | `chat_handle_join` | Relates handles to chats in source ledger. | Feeds chat membership.
| `db-working` | `handles` | Canonicalized handles powering UI queries. | Updated via migrators.
| `db-overlay` | `handle_to_participant_overrides` | User overrides for handle → participant or virtual participant mapping. | Overlay-only; working DB is not modified by manual linking.

## External Inputs
- Rust extractor surfaces raw handle metadata from `chat.db`.
- Manual override service writes via `ManualHandleLinkService`.

## Downstream Consumers
- Chats feature for participant roster.
- Messages feature for sender resolution.
- Search feature for handle-based lookups.

## Data Contracts
- Canonical handle must remain stable across re-imports.
- Service + normalized address pair uniquely identifies a handle.
- Manual overrides must reconcile with future imports without duplication.
