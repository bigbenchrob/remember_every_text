# Interactions & Navigation — Chats

> Current conformance note (2026-04-21): there is no current `ViewSpec.chats` variant. Treat chat-list panel references below as draft/historical until code introduces a top-level chat ViewSpec or another canonical entry point.

## Primary Entry Points
- Recent chat/timeline support through `lib/features/chats` providers and widgets.
- Deep links from search and notifications to specific chat detail.

## User Flows
1. **Launch → Chat List** — loads pinned chats then recent chats ordered by last activity.
2. **Select Chat** — updates panels to show chat detail and message timeline.
3. **Pin/Archive Chat** — toggles overlay state, updates projections.
4. **Mark All Read** — clears unread counters and propagates to message view.

## Cross-Feature Touchpoints
- Messages feature listens for active `chatId` selection to fetch timeline.
- Search feature links back into chats list by `chatId`.
- Chat handles feature ensures participant roster is resolved before detail view renders.

## Navigation Guardrails
- Use ViewSpec-driven navigation; ensure panel coordinators react to chat selection.
- Maintain derived state (selected chat, filters) in providers, not ad-hoc widget state.
- Provide consistent fallback panel when no chat is selected.

## Outstanding Decisions
- Finalize chat list filtering (archived vs. active in separate panels?).
- Determine policy for multi-window or split view scenarios on macOS.
