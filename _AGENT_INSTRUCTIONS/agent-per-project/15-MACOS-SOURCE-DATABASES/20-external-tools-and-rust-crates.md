# External Tools And Rust Crates

These references are useful when validating assumptions about Apple’s source databases outside the MessageLens codebase.

## Authority Boundary

This document is external validation reference. External tools may clarify Apple source-schema behavior, but they do not define MessageLens import, migration, archive, or UI architecture.

The current runtime typedstream path is MessageLens's own Rust extractor, documented in `../20-DATA-IMPORT-MIGRATION/11-rust-message-extractor.md`, invoked by the import pipeline, and written back into the import ledger. New app behavior must follow the internal pipeline contracts even when an external crate models the same Apple data differently.

## `imessage_database` Rust Crate

Reference:

- `https://docs.rs/imessage-database/latest/imessage_database/`

Why it matters:

- provides Rust table models for iMessage sqlite data
- includes read-only connection helpers and streaming APIs
- includes message deserialization helpers such as `generate_text()`
- is useful for cross-checking how an external tool interprets `chat.db`

Example value to this repo:

- compare MessageLens import assumptions against a separate parser
- inspect message/body recovery behavior without running the Flutter app
- validate whether specific source rows are considered messages, reactions, attachments, or decoded rich text by another mature codebase

## `imessage-exporter` Docs

References:

- `https://github.com/ReagentX/imessage-exporter/tree/develop/docs`
- `https://github.com/ReagentX/imessage-exporter/tree/develop/docs/tables`

Why it matters:

- documents `chat.db`-adjacent schema and export behavior
- provides reverse-engineering context for Apple-owned message data structures
- complements the crate docs with narrative documentation and diagnostics guidance

## `imessage-exporter` / `imessage-database` Typedstream Work

Reference:

- `https://chrissardegna.com/blog/reverse-engineering-apples-typedstream-format/`

This analysis underpins how external tooling recovers `attributedBody` content. MessageLens’s own Rust extractor solves the same problem space and should be evaluated against these findings whenever typedstream decoding regresses.

## Use In This Repository

External tools are for:

- schema understanding
- source-data validation
- reverse-engineering support
- sanity checks when source-db behavior contradicts import assumptions

They are not the source of truth for MessageLens architecture. Internal
source-scoped import, graph projection, retained compatibility, and UI
decisions remain governed by this repository's docs and code.

Do not copy external export semantics into MessageLens without reconciling them against current internal boundaries:

- source `chat.db` rows map through `macos_import_ss.db` before reaching
  `working_ss.db`
- graph-orphan/recovered rows stay separate from normal chat-linked messages
- Apple attachment paths are volatile source hints, not durable archive guarantees
- overlay archive and deterministic recovery decisions remain MessageLens-owned
