# Contact → Chat Linking Walkthrough

This walkthrough captures the end-to-end path a macOS AddressBook contact takes to appear in `db-working` chat views. Use it to double-check the import and migration contract whenever you touch handle/contact logic.

## 1. Resolve the Live AddressBook Bundle

- Always obtain AddressBook paths through `getFolderAggregateEitherProvider` (see `06-addressbook-path-resolution.md`). The provider inspects the `Sources/` subdirectories and returns the active bundle so importers never attach stale SQLite files.

## 2. Import Phase (Ledger Population)

- `ImportOrchestrator` runs table importers for AddressBook and Messages data (`../20-DATA-IMPORT-MIGRATION/10-import-orchestrator.md`).
- Contacts land in `db-import` tables:
  - `contacts` – preserves `Z_PK`, display names, organisation flags.
  - `contact_phone_email` – normalised phone/email rows keyed by `ZOWNER`.
  - `contact_to_chat_handle` – matches between AddressBook contacts and chat handles, including confidence scores and batch IDs.
- Chat handles import into ledger `handles` and membership rows populate `chat_to_handle`.
- Ledger tables retain source identifiers and batch provenance. Incremental import preserves existing rows; full/reimport flows may clear and rebuild source-derived ledger tables through import code (`../20-DATA-IMPORT-MIGRATION/02-import-migration-schema-reference.md`).

## 3. Migration Phase (Projection Population)

- `HandlesMigrationService` invokes `MigrationOrchestrator` to copy ledger data into `db-working` (`../20-DATA-IMPORT-MIGRATION/20-migration-orchestrator.md`).
- Migrators run in topological dependency order. The current contact path depends on handles, participants, handle-to-participant links, chat membership, and messages using canonical maps supplied by `MigrationContext`.

### Key Migrator Outputs

| Working Table | Source | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `handles_canonical` | `db-import.handles` | Canonicalise handles using a stable source handle ID for each canonical row. |
| `handles_canonical_to_alias` | Migration canonical map | Record every raw/normalised source variant pointing to the canonical handle. |
| `participants` | `db-import.contacts` | Project AddressBook contacts, keeping `Z_PK` as the participant ID. Drift class name: `WorkingParticipants`. |
| `handle_to_participant` | `db-import.contact_to_chat_handle` | Materialise confidence-scored links between canonical handles and participants. |
| `chat_to_handle` | Ledger `chat_to_handle` | Rebuild chat membership using canonical handle IDs. |

## 4. Resulting Relationship in `db-working`

When migrators complete:

1. Each projectable AddressBook contact has a row in `participants` (ID == original `Z_PK`).
2. Every handle variant observed during import is canonicalised through `MigrationContext.handleIdCanonicalMap` and linked via `handles_canonical_to_alias`.
3. `handle_to_participant` ties canonical handles back to the participant.
4. `chat_to_handle` stores chat membership referencing the same canonical handle IDs.

Joining `participants → handle_to_participant → chat_to_handle → chats` yields all chats associated with that AddressBook contact. No runtime recomputation is required; the projection enforces the relationship during migration.

Keep this walkthrough handy when implementing importers, migrators, or UI flows that depend on contact-to-chat linkage. It outlines the canonical path and identifies the tables responsible for every step.
