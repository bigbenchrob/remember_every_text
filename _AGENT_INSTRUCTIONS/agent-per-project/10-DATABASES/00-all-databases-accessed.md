# All Databases Accessed

This is the canonical index for every SQLite database the project touches. Treat it as the jumping-off point before drilling into individual docs.

For a plain-language explanation of archive roots, access authority, persistent
providers, operation coordination, maintenance locking, and source identity,
start with
[`access_authority_documentation/010-DATABASE-ACCESS-IN-PLAIN-ENGLISH.md`](access_authority_documentation/010-DATABASE-ACCESS-IN-PLAIN-ENGLISH.md).

## 🚨 Read This First

- **Resolve AddressBook paths via providers only.** Use `getFolderAggregateEitherProvider` (documented in `06-addressbook-path-resolution.md`). Never hardcode `/Sources/<UUID>/...`.
- **Persistent app DB instances are centralized.** Long-lived application
  databases must be constructed only through Riverpod providers exported by
  `lib/essentials/db/feature_level_providers.dart`; implementation lives in
  named files under `lib/essentials/db/feature_level_providers/`.
  Infrastructure repositories
  may open source/probe SQLite files directly only for named one-off
  read-only queries, and must close/dispose the connection before returning.
  Extra persistent connections will lock app database files.
- **Archive admission precedes persistent construction.** Every app-owned
  persistent provider requires the immutable `ArchiveAccessAuthority` injected
  after native claim and archive-marker validation. Debug/Profile use the
  development root, production uses the stable production root, and tests must
  inject a temporary root. There is no Application Support fallback.
- **There is no erase-only archive authority.** A meaningful unmarked or
  incompatible archive fails closed into ordinary remediation. Runtime cannot
  admit an archive solely to delete or replace its complete root. Previously
  distributed tester journals are handled only by the bounded compatibility
  seam documented in Feature 28; that seam can remove the unchanged obsolete
  journal in proven-safe stale states and cannot open a destructive authority.
- **Path access uses the paths seam.** Code that needs `PathsHelper` should
  import `pathsHelperProvider` from
  `lib/essentials/paths/feature_level_providers.dart`, not the root
  `providers.dart` barrel. The root provider barrel is retired; add or consume
  owned essential seams instead.
- **Physical file identity stays explicit.** Database file names are
  centralized in `lib/essentials/db/app_database_files.dart`. Physical roots
  come only from admitted archive authority. The retired mutable
  `database_directory.dart` path primitive must not be recreated or replaced
  with another process-global path.
- **Mutation authority is archive-scoped.** Protected reset, rebuild, import,
  historical archive, and attachment operations use
  `ArchiveMutationCoordinator`. `dbMaintenanceLockProvider` remains a derived
  readiness/UI signal exposed through the DB seam; it is not an independent
  resource authority. Fresh graph construction asks the coordinator whether
  the requesting async branch owns the active mutation and whether that
  branch's current operation scope permits the requested graph action.
  Historical import/removal owners may therefore construct the graph resource
  they legitimately require after admission, while unrelated callers remain
  mechanically excluded. Nested scopes preserve the strongest active safety
  restriction. The Boolean maintenance signal remains useful for coarse
  readiness and presentation only.
- **Public provider seam imports stay narrow.** When a file imports
  `feature_level_providers.dart` from another feature or essential module, it
  must use an explicit `show` list. Broad seam imports hide database and
  lifecycle authority even when the dependency is otherwise legitimate.
- **Production reads are graph-backed.** Ordinary app data flows through `db-import-ss` and `db-graph-working`; archive-source metadata now lives in `db-overlay`. Retired `db-import` and `db-working` files are transitional cleanup inventory for reset and diagnostics.
- **Overlay remains separate.** User intent lives in `db-overlay` and is merged at read time; no import/projection path may copy overlay intent into source-scoped graph tables or retired files.
- **The attachment archive is preservation data.** It shares the admitted
  archive root but is not a database, cache, or rebuildable reset target.
  Reset/reimport/recovery may delete only enumerated derived database files.
  See
  [`ATTACHMENT-PRESERVATION-INVARIANT.md`](../25-ONBOARDING-AND-ARCHIVE/ATTACHMENT-PRESERVATION-INVARIANT.md).
  There is no whole-installation runtime exception. Every supported reset or
  recovery path preserves the archive root, marker identity, and attachment
  preservation data while mutating only an explicit resource inventory.
- **Shut everything down before manual access.** Quit the Flutter app and tooling prior to backups or ad-hoc SQL to avoid WAL/locking surprises.
- **Historical ROWID use requires lineage admission.** Before a Historical
  Archives operation may rely on original Apple Messages ROWIDs, it must pass
  the canonical shared gate documented in
  [`15-messages-lineage-admission.md`](15-messages-lineage-admission.md).

## Canonical Database Aliases

Use these aliases consistently across docs, code comments, and conversations.

| Alias | Physical File | Primary Purpose | Provider Entry Point | Storage Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `db-address-book` | `AddressBook-v22.abcddb` inside the most recent `/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/Sources/<UUID>/` | macOS contact source of truth | `getFolderAggregateEitherProvider` → `AddressBookFolderAggregate.mostRecentFolderPath` | Resolved dynamically at runtime |
| `db-chat` | `chat.db` | macOS Messages source ledger | `pathsHelperProvider` from `lib/essentials/paths/feature_level_providers.dart` → `PathsHelper.messagesDatabasePath` (import pipeline) | `~/Library/Messages/chat.db` |
| `db-import-ss` | `macos_import_ss.db` | Environment-scoped source import ledger for Messages + AddressBook facts | Physical access: `sourceScopedImportDatabaseProvider` exported by `lib/essentials/db/feature_level_providers.dart`; ordinary import/projection semantics: `sourceScopedImportLedgerProvider` | Admitted archive root |
| `db-graph-working` | `working_ss.db` | Environment-scoped conversation graph consumed by graph readers and Message Evidence Spine | `driftConversationGraphDatabaseProvider` | Admitted archive root |
| `db-import` | `macos_import.db` | Retired import cleanup file; old files may contain historical ledger tables, but current diagnostics name only archive-source cleanup inventory | No central app provider; reset/diagnostics treat as retired cleanup inventory | Admitted archive root, if present |
| `db-working` | `working.db` | Retired working cleanup file; old projection tables may exist, but current diagnostics name only recovered-message cleanup inventory | No central app provider; reset/diagnostics treat as retired cleanup inventory | Admitted archive root, if present |
| `db-overlay` | `user_overlays.db` | Long-lived user overrides, archive metadata, and window state | `overlayDatabaseProvider` | Admitted archive root |
| `db-presence` | `presence.db` | Presence definitions, composition, run checkpoints, and execution trace | Physical access: `presenceDatabaseProvider`; ordinary execution: `presenceScheduleRepositoryProvider` | Admitted archive root |

## Coupled Database Groups

- **`group-source-scoped-graph-db`**: `db-import-ss` and `db-graph-working` are the environment-scoped graph pipeline. Source data lands in the import ledger, then graph projectors translate it into canonical `ss_id` rows and topology.
- **`group-retired-import-working-db`**: `db-import` and `db-working` are retired storage references, not an active pipeline. Old retired files may be inspected read-only by diagnostics or removed by reset cleanup. Do not use this group for new ordinary app reads or archive-source metadata writes.

## Source → Projection Flow

```
macOS AddressBook (db-address-book)
            +
 macOS Messages (db-chat)
            ↓
     db-import-ss (source-scoped ledger)
            ↓
     db-graph-working (conversation graph)
            ↕
     db-overlay (user overrides merged by providers)
```

## Provider Access Map

- `db-address-book`: `getFolderAggregateEitherProvider` (features/address_book_folders) → `AddressBookFolderAggregate.mostRecentFolderPath`.
- `db-chat`: retrieved via `pathsHelperProvider` / `PathsHelper` inside
  import/monitor infrastructure; feature and presentation code must not open it
  directly or import the root `providers.dart` barrel just to resolve paths.
- `db-import-ss`: physical provider access is
  `sourceScopedImportDatabaseProvider` from the public DB seam
  `lib/essentials/db/feature_level_providers.dart`; physical construction is
  implemented in the DB-provider subfile and should not be imported directly by
  consumers. Source-scoped import, graph projection, archive snapshot, and
  diagnostic semantics should consume `sourceScopedImportLedgerProvider` or a
  named repository/query layer instead of reaching for the concrete import
  database.
- `db-graph-working`: `driftConversationGraphDatabaseProvider` from `lib/essentials/db/feature_level_providers.dart`.
- `db-import`: no central app provider remains; retired transitional cleanup file only.
- `db-working`: no central app provider remains; retired transitional cleanup file only.
- `db-overlay`: `overlayDatabaseProvider` (generated from `overlayDatabase`) for user intent and archive-source metadata.
- `db-presence`: physical construction uses `presenceDatabaseProvider` from
  the public DB seam. Presence execution consumes
  `presenceScheduleRepositoryProvider`, which injects runtime Agent resolution
  into generic persisted definitions.

## Concrete Import-Ledger Provider Access

`sourceScopedImportDatabaseProvider` is a physical DB provider, not a general
feature dependency. Direct access is limited to:

- the central DB provider implementation that constructs it;
- the semantic `sourceScopedImportLedgerProvider` bridge;
- reset cleanup that must close the live database handle before deleting files;
- database health/audit query layers that deliberately inspect physical
  database files and schemas.

Ordinary import services, graph projection, archive attachment snapshot lookup,
graph readers, feature providers, widgets, and presentation code must consume
semantic ports, repository providers, or `sourceScopedImportLedgerProvider`
instead of reaching for the concrete physical provider.

## Current-Mac Message Coverage

Message History Coverage is a cross-store reconciliation, not a comparison of
gross database counts.

- The denominator is every physical `ROWID` currently present in
  `db-chat.message`.
- Source-scoped import owns the named, read-only source evidence reader.
- Conversation Graph owns the named source-1 topology evidence reader.
- Graph identity is decoded only through `SourceScopedRowSql` and the canonical
  live-source identity.
- Settings composes the evidence and partitions each denominator identity into
  conversation-linked, recovered/unlinked, or unaccounted.
- Historical-source graph rows and ephemeral attachment-recovery donors do not
  participate.

Coverage must never subtract gross graph totals, clamp a negative remainder,
or open the protected graph store while admitted maintenance is active. See
[Feature 27](../45-NEW-FEATURE-ADDITION/27-MESSAGE-HISTORY-COVERAGE/README.md).

## Persistent vs One-Off Database Access

- Persistent DB instances: import ledger, conversation graph, overlay,
  Presence, and any future long-lived app database must be physically
  constructed in named files
  under `lib/essentials/db/feature_level_providers/` and exported by
  `lib/essentials/db/feature_level_providers.dart`.
- Cross-feature DB lifecycle signals: the maintenance lock is consumed through
  the DB public seam because it reports reset/rebuild/archive maintenance to
  readers and presentation across features. It does not decide owner-specific
  resource admission. The graph provider asks `ArchiveMutationCoordinator`
  directly through the archive-environment seam. Narrow refresh/readiness
  signals such as graph readiness or message-data version may use their
  explicit provider files when a tripwire requires narrow imports to avoid
  broad DB authority.
- Environment Readiness and ordinary graph-readiness providers must not open
  either `macos_import_ss.db` or `working_ss.db` for observational row counts
  or probes while admitted maintenance is active. They report the truthful
  maintenance state and wait for authority to release before refreshing those
  facts. A database busy timeout is bounded contention tolerance only; it does
  not authorize unrelated readiness reads during maintenance.
- One-off source/probe reads: infrastructure repositories may open `chat.db`,
  AddressBook candidates, historical archive `chat.db` files, or retired
  cleanup files for a named read-only query. They must set read-only/query-only
  mode where practical, return typed results, and close/dispose the handle in a
  `finally` block.
  Sqflite probes must use isolated read-only handles (`singleInstance: false`
  for direct `openDatabase` calls) and set `PRAGMA query_only = ON` plus
  `PRAGMA busy_timeout = 3000` before issuing reads. Direct probe `rawQuery`
  calls must pass SQL through a named read-only SQL guard such as
  `assertReadOnlySql(...)`; the retired/import-ledger writer is the explicit
  exception because it owns its mutable schema and write transaction boundary.
- Presentation, application orchestration, feature widgets, and ordinary
  read-model code must never open database files directly.

## When to Touch What

| Need | Database(s) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inspect raw macOS Contacts | `db-address-book` | Only via provider overrides in tooling/tests; ensure Full Disk Access. |
| Inspect raw macOS Messages | `db-chat` | Read-only; consumed by import/monitor infrastructure. |
| Verify production source-scoped import batches or schema diffs | `db-import-ss` | Treat as source-derived and importer-owned; agents must never mutate rows manually. |
| Debug app-visible graph state | `db-graph-working` | Graph projection backing ordinary app reads. Manual edits are overwritten by graph rebuild. |
| Inspect retired cleanup/diagnostic storage | `db-import` / `db-working` | Diagnostics/cleanup only; do not use as the authority for ordinary UI behavior or archive-source metadata. |
| Review manual overrides (handles, UI prefs) | `db-overlay` | Persistent user customizations. Follow overlay independence rules before editing. |
| Inspect Presence definitions, checkpoints, or trace | `db-presence` | Prefer the repository and development inspection tools. Agent identities are persisted declarations; runtime Agent implementations are supplied by composition. |
