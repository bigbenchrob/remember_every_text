/// Feature-owned spec for Contacts "info" cassettes.
///
/// Lives with the Contacts feature since the keys and their meanings
/// are feature-owned. Re-exported by `essentials/sidebar/feature_level_providers.dart`
/// so the sidebar cascade topology can reference it.
///
/// This allows:
/// - centralized spec routing (CassetteSpec.* variants)
/// - feature-owned meaning (InfoContentResolver)
/// - reuse of the same key for future surfaces (tooltips/onboarding) without changing
///   this cassette spec unless the sidebar needs new variants.
///
/// When to add new variants here:
/// - Only when the sidebar needs a structurally different kind of "info cassette"
///   (e.g., a warning banner vs. an info card, or something with actions).
/// - If the only change is wording/data, add a new key instead.
