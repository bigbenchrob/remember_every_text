/// Sidebar-surface spec for Handles "info" cassettes.
///
/// IMPORTANT:
/// - This is a *sidebar protocol* entity, so it lives under `essentials/sidebar/...`.
/// - It does NOT contain explanatory text directly.
/// - It carries only a *feature-owned key* that the Handles feature will resolve
///   into surface-agnostic InfoContent.
///
/// This allows:
/// - centralized spec routing (CassetteSpec.* variants)
/// - feature-owned meaning (HandlesInfoContentResolver)
/// - reuse of the same key for future surfaces (tooltips/onboarding) without changing
///   this cassette spec unless the sidebar needs new variants.
///
/// When to add new variants here:
/// - Only when the sidebar needs a structurally different kind of "info cassette"
///   (e.g., a warning banner vs. an info card, or something with actions).
/// - If the only change is wording/data, add a new key instead.

/// - it allows the spec to remain lightweight

/// Alternative (later):
/// - Move this enum into the Handles feature and reference it here by import.
/// - That is a larger dependency refactor because essentials then depends on feature code.
/// For now, keep it here to avoid circular dependencies.
